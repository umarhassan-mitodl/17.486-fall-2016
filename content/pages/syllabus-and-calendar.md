Course Description
------------------

This subject is designed for graduate students interested in international politics, national security and comparative political economy in East Asia. It examines the political, military, and economic challenges facing Japan, its neighbors, and the international system under conditions of change and uncertainty. Topics range from the history of once "new" world orders to theories that inform our understanding of international affairs and foreign policy decision-making, as each is related to Japan. We focus on Japanese bilateral, regional, and global security policies from a range of theoretical perspectives.

Assignments
-----------

*   A précis (2 pages)
*   A short scenario paper (10 pages)
*   A longer briefing paper (up to 25 pages)
*   An oral presentation in class

For more information on the course assignments, see the {{% resource_link 074d71ee-9c51-65c2-03ce-d5b36dd08043 "Assignments" %}} section.

Active, informed seminar participation will be a large part of the student evaluation.
